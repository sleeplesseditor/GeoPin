# GeoPin

A real-time geolocation app for sharing media and review about locations/venues, built using Reed Barger's [Udemy course](http://www.udemy.com/build-a-realtime-app-with-react-hooks-and-graphql) as a guide. Users are able to tag places ofn interest with an image and information (as well as manage their own pins). Other users are able to leave comments on individual pins. The app is built using React (with Hooks), GraphQL, Express and MongoDB.

The app is live via Heroku and Now and can be viewed [here](https://geopin.sleeplesseditor.now.sh/). Google OAuth is used for account management and security.
